NAME
    Dist::Zilla::MintingProfile::MooseXDeclare - A minting profile for
    Modules written with MooseX::Declare

VERSION
    version 0.400

SYNOPSIS
         dzil new -P MooseXDeclare -p App New::App

    or

         dzil new -P MooseXDeclare New::App

    This is a minting profile for projects using MooseX::Declare.

    It comes in two flavors: one for Apps (with more boilerplate stuff) and
    one for "regular" classes.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    Unfortunately, in the App-flavored Minting Process, I can't get
    Dist::Zilla to create my favorite structure exactly as I want it, so you
    need to run `mkdir -p lib/New/App/{Command,Types}; touch $_.pm` after
    the `dzil new` call.

    (From there copy paste stuff from lib/New/App.pm to the correct places)

    Additionally, I can't get Dist::Zilla to carry out the substituion of
    `New::App` for `{{$name}}` in the minting process across more that one
    file. Sorry about that and any inconveniences this may cause you --
    patches and hints are welcome!
